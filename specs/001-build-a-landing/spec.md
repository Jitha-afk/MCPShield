# Feature Specification: MCP Shield ‚Äî Landing Page

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-landing`  
**Created**: 2025-09-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a landing page for a windows based tool called MCP Shield, that monitors MCP (Model Context Protocol) calls for security, inspired by recent MCP vulnerabilities and attacks (e.g., prompt injection). The solution will leverage local inferencing (NPU/GPU) for the demo, with a long-term goal of supporting Copilot+ PCs. The design should be fully fluid. Modern and worthy of getting into awwwards"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
	‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
	‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
	‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
	‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
	‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
	‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
	‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Security engineers, privacy officers, and power users running Windows/Copilot+ PCs want a clear, modern landing page that explains MCP Shield ‚Äî a local-first monitoring agent for Model Context Protocol (MCP) calls ‚Äî so they understand value, privacy guarantees, demo capabilities (local NPU/GPU inference), and how to try the demo locally.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor lands on the homepage, **When** they scan the hero section, **Then** they immediately understand MCP Shield's purpose, key benefits (security, privacy, local inference), and see clear CTA to "Try Demo" or "Download".
2. **Given** a visitor selects "Try Demo (Local)", **When** the demo modal launches, **Then** it shows a short guided demo that runs a local inference placeholder (simulated NPU/GPU) and displays detected MCP call anomalies (ex: prompt injection attempts) in real-time.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user's machine cannot run local inference (no NPU/GPU drivers)? ‚Üí The demo falls back to a simulated demo mode and displays a clear badge: "Simulation Mode ‚Äî Local inferencing unavailable".
- How does the page behave on extremely small viewports or very large displays? ‚Üí Fully fluid layout must preserve hierarchy, with accessible stacking order and readable typography.
- What happens if the user denies permissions required by any local helper? ‚Üí The demo displays a non-blocking message with steps to enable necessary permissions, and the rest of the landing content remains interactive.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The landing page MUST present MCP Shield's core proposition in a concise hero area (what it is, who it's for, primary benefits).
- **FR-002**: The landing page MUST include an interactive demo CTA which launches a client-side demo (local inference placeholder or simulation) to illustrate detection of MCP-related threats (e.g., prompt injection, context exfiltration).
- **FR-003**: The landing page MUST be fully fluid/responsive ‚Äî it should adapt continuously across viewport sizes without fixed breakpoints that break the layout.
- **FR-004**: The landing page MUST include privacy and security statements explaining local-first inference (no external model calls by default) and a clear data handling summary.
- **FR-005**: The landing page MUST include a technical overview section describing architecture at a conceptual level (agent monitors MCP calls, local inference engine, alert surface), without implementation details.
- **FR-006**: The landing page MUST provide clear developer and user next steps (Download, Try Demo, Docs, GitHub) and a contact / security/bug report avenue.
- **FR-007**: The landing page MUST provide fallback behavior for devices without NPU/GPU, indicating simulation mode and preserving UX.
- **FR-008**: The landing page MUST load quickly (target: first contentful paint under 1s on modern desktop networks) and show progressive content if resources are delayed.
- **FR-009**: All interactive elements MUST be keyboard accessible and comply with basic WCAG AA contrast and semantics.


### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Visitor (Persona)**: A person browsing the site; primary attributes: role (security engineer, power user), platform (Windows/Copilot+), technical comfort.
- **Demo Session**: Ephemeral client-side session representing a demo run; attributes: mode (real local inference | simulation), detected events (list of threat events), timestamps. Data MUST NOT be persisted by default.
